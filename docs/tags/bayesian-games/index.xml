      <description>1 Bayesian games with discrete actions We consider the following variant of battle of sexes, where there are two states of nature: \(Ω = \{ω_1, ω_2 \}\). In \(ω_1\), player 2 wants to meet player 1, and in \(ω_2\) player 2 wants to avoid player \(1\). The payoffs of the game are:
We assume that the prior beliefs are \[ p(ω_1) = \tfrac 12 \quad p(ω_2) = \tfrac 12. \]</description>
