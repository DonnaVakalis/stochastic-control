      <description>Radio frequenccy (RF) jamming is the act of blocking or causing interference to radio or wireless communication by transmitting noise to decrease the signal to noise ration. Jamming of radio transmission originated in World War II and is even used today in military and civilian conflicts. See wikipedia article on jamming for details.
We will consider a simple model of jamming and obtain a using using tools from zero sum games.</description>
