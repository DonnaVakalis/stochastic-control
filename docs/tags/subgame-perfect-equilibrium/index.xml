      <description>So far, we have restricted attention to simultaneous move static games, i.e., games in which all players act only once. We either assumed that all players have full information about the payoffs of all players or, in settings with imperfect information, assumed that the information available to the players is exogeneous and does not depend on the actions of other players. In this section, we look at more general settings.</description>
