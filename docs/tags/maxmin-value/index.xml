      <description>As we saw, the notion of rationalizability is attractive, but it makes strong assumptions about other players and does not always prescribe a solution. We will now describe a notion of rationality of a player that does not rely on rationality of other players, and even makes the most pessimistic assessment of their potential behavior.
As an example, consider the game shown below.
\(\mathsf{L}\) \(\mathsf{R}\) \(\mathsf{T}\) \(2\) \(1\) \(2\) \(-20\) \(\mathsf{M}\) \(3\) \(0\) \(-10\) \(1\) \(\mathsf{B}\) \(-100\) \(2\) \(3\) \(3\) In this game \(\mathsf{T}\) is an attractive strategy for the row player because it guarantees a payoff of \(2\) and also ensures that the “risky” payoffs of \(-10\) and \(-100\) are avoided.</description>
