      <description>So far, we have considered models with a single decision maker. As mentioned in the notes on stochastic optimization, the simplest decision problem is as follows. A decision maker has to choose an action \(a \in \ALPHABET A\). Upon choosing the action \(a\), the decision maker incurs a cost \(c(a)\) (or, equivalently, receives a payoff or a utility \(u(a)\)). What action should the decision maker pick to minimize the cost (or, equivalently, maximize the payoff).</description>
