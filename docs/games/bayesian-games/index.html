<div class="h1-title">Theory: Bayesian games</div>

<p>So far we have assumed that all players know all the relevant information about each other. Such games are known as <strong>games with complete information</strong>. In this section, we consider <strong>games with incomplete information</strong>, i.e., games where players have private information about something relevant to their decision making.</p>
<p>Consider the following variation of battle of sexes. There are two players. As before, player 1 wants to go out with player 2 and prefers to go watch a football game over watching opera. However, there are two <em>types</em> of player 2: type 1 or type 2. Player 2 of type 1 wants to go out with player 1 and prefers to go to opera over football. On the other hand, player 2 of type 2 does not want to go out with player 1 and prefers opera over football. Player two knows his type (i.e., knows his preferences). Player 1 knows that there are two types of player 2, but does not know if he is playing against player 2 of type 1 or player 2 of type 2.</p>
The above situation can be modeled as follows:
<table style="border:none; border-collapse:collapse">

    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{F}$</td>

<td style="padding-left:4em">
P2 of type 2
</td>

<p>In order to complete the description of the game, we need to provide a probability distribution on the types of player 2. In this particular example, we need to assume that player 1 has a belief on the type of player 2 and assume that this belief is common knowledge between the two players.</p>
<p>When both players have multiple types, the situation is more complicated. Suppose player 1 has a belief on the types of player 2, and player 2 has a belief on the types of player 1 and both these beliefs are common knowledge. This leads to some conceptual intricacies. Suppose there is a random event in nature and player 1 and player 2 have different beliefs on this random event. Now suppose the beliefs of both players are made common knowledge. Each player will then update their beliefs to incorporate the knoweldge of the other player’s belief. Can the posterior beliefs disagree on the probability of an event? <span class="citation" data-cites="Aumann1976">Aumann (<a href="#ref-Aumann1976" role="doc-biblioref">1976</a>)</span> showed that players <em>cannot agree to disagree</em>.</p>
<p>In light of Aumann’s <span class="citation" data-cites="Aumann1976">(<a href="#ref-Aumann1976" role="doc-biblioref">1976</a>)</span> result, we start with the assumption that there is a joint probability measure on the types of all players (and that measure is common knowledge). This leads to the following definition of Bayesian game.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<dl>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Bayesian game is a tuple <span class="math inline">\(\langle \ALPHABET N, (\ALPHABET A_i)_{i \in \ALPHABET N}, (T_i)_{i \in  \ALPHABET N}, p, (u_i)_{i \in \ALPHABET N} \rangle\)</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET N\)</span> is the set of players.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET A_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i \in \ALPHABET N\)</span>, is the set of actions for player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. As before, we use <span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET A = \prod_{i \in \ALPHABET N} \ALPHABET A_i\)</span> to denote the set of joint action of all players.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET T_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i \in \ALPHABET N\)</span>, the the set of <em>types</em> of player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We use <span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET T = \prod_{i \in \ALPHABET N}\)</span> to denote the set of joint types of all players.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is probability measure on the joint types <span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET T\)</span>, which satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{t_{-i} \in \ALPHABET T_{-i}} p(t_i, t_{-i}) &gt; 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t_i \in \ALPHABET T_i\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(u_i \colon \ALPHABET A × \ALPHABET T \to \reals\)</span> is the utility function of player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> which depends on the action profile and the type profile of all players.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>As in the case of complete-information games, it is assumed that all of the components of the game are common knowledge to all players. The game proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A chance move (or nature) chooses a type vector <span class="math inline">\(t = (t_1, \dots, t_n) \in \ALPHABET T\)</span> according to probabilty distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Each player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> knows that type <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has been selected for him (i.e., his own type), but does not know the type <span class="math inline">\(t_{-i}\)</span> of other players.</li>
<li>The players select their actions simultaneously; each player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> knowing his type <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> selects an action <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in \ALPHABET A_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>Each player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> receives a payoff <span class="math inline">\(u_i(a,t)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a = (a_1, \dots, a_n)\)</span> is the action profile of all players.</li>
</ul>
<p>A pure strategy in Bayesian game is a mapping from the player type to his action space, i.e., <span class="math display">\[
  s_i \colon \ALPHABET T_i \to \ALPHABET A_i.
\]</span> A mixed strategy, as usual, is a probability distribution over pure strategies (i.e., a probability distribution over functions!). Given a strategy profile <span class="math inline">\(s=(s_i, s_{-i})\)</span> and a type profile <span class="math inline">\(t = (t_i, t_{-i})\)</span>, we use the notation <span class="math inline">\(s_i(t_i), s_{-i}(t_{-i}))\)</span> to denote the action profile generated when players of type profile <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> play strategy profile <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can divide a Bayesian game into three phases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Ex-ante phase</strong>, where no player knows his type or the types of any other player. When we reason about a strategy in this phase, we use the following expected utility: <span class="math display">\[
   U_i(s_i, s_{-i}) = \sum_{t \in \ALPHABET T}p(t)u_i(s_i(t_i), s_{-i}(t_{-i})).
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interim phase</strong>, where the players know there own type but not the types of other players. When we reason about this phase, we use the following expected utility: <span class="math display">\[
   U_i(a_i, s_{-i} \mid t_i) = 
   \sum_{t_{-i} \in \ALPHABET T_{-i}} p(t_{-i}|t_i) u_i(a_i, s_{-i}(t_{-i})) 
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
 p(t_{-i} \mid t_i) = \frac{p(t_i, t_{-i})}{ \sum\limits_{t&#39;_i \in \ALPHABET T_i}
 p(t&#39;_i, t_{-i}) }
  \]</span> is the posterior belief of player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> on the types <span class="math inline">\(t_{-i}\)</span> of other players given his own type <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ex-post phase</strong>, where the players know their own types and the types of every other player. When we reason about this phase, we use the following utility: <span class="math display">\[
   u_i(s_i(t_i), s_{-i}(t_{-i})).
\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="1" id="bayesian-nash-equilibrium"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Bayesian Nash equilibrium</h1>
<p>Based on the three interpretation of the games, we can define three notions of equilibrium fro Bayesian games. We discuss the first two here and will talk about the third one later.</p>
<p>Based on the ex-ante view of the game, we can define a notion of equilibrium as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<dl>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>
<p>A strategy profile <span class="math inline">\(s^* = (s^*_1, \dots, s^*_n)\)</span> is an <strong>ex-ante Bayesian Nash equilibrium</strong> if <span class="math display">\[
  U_i(s^*_i, s^*_{-i}) \ge U_i(s_i, s^*_{-i}),
  \quad \forall s_i \colon \ALPHABET T_i \to \ALPHABET A_i, 
  \forall i \in \ALPHABET N.
\]</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Based on the interim view of the game, we can define a notion of equilibrium as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<dl>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>
<p>A strategy profile <span class="math inline">\(s^* = (s^*_1, \dots, s^*_n)\)</span> is an <strong>interim Bayesian Nash equilibrium</strong> if <span class="math display">\[
  U_i(s^*_i(t_i), s^*_{-i} \mid t_i) \ge U_i(a_i, s^*_{-i} \mid t_i),
  \quad \forall a_i \in \ALPHABET A_i, t_i \in \ALPHABET T_i, 
  \forall i \in \ALPHABET N.
\]</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>By definition, the interim equilibrium appears to be a stronger notion that ex-anti equilibrium; taking expectation over types in the definition of interim Bayesian Nash equilibrium implies the definition of ex-ante Bayesian Nash equilibrium. However, it turns out the the other implication is also true.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<dl>
<dt><span id="thm:1"></span><span id="thm:BNE" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 1</strong></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ex-ante and interim Bayesian Nash equilibrium are equivalent and they are simply referred to as <strong>Bayesian Nash equilibrium</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="proof">Proof</h4>
<p>See https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs1951k/lectures/2020/bayesian_games.pdf</p>
<dl>
<dt>Remark</dt>
<dd>
<p>Since Bayesian Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium of the ex-ante view of the game (also called normal form reduction), standard results on the existence of Nash equilibrium imply the existence of Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In particular, a finite game with a finite number of types always has Bayesian Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="an-equivalent-formulation"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> An equivalent formulation</h2>
<p>It is sometimes more convenient to consider an alternative but equivalent formulation of the a Bayesian game.</p>
<p>In the previous definition of Bayesian game we assumed that the types of all players <span class="math inline">\((T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n)\)</span> are correlated random variables. This means that they are defined on a common probability space <span class="math inline">\((Ω, \mathfrak{F}, \PR)\)</span> and there exist measurable functions <span class="math inline">\(τ_i \colon Ω \to \ALPHABET T_i\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(T_i = τ_i(ω)\)</span>. Based on this view, we can define a Bayesian game as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<dl>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Bayesian game is a tuple <span class="math inline">\(\langle \ALPHABET N, (\ALPHABET A_i)_{i \in \ALPHABET N}, (\ALPHABET T_i)_{i \in \ALPHABET N}, (Ω,\mathfrak{F}, \PR), (τ_i)_{i \in \ALPHABET N}, (u_i)_{i \in \ALPHABET N} \rangle\)</span>, where</p>

As before, we use <span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET A = \prod_{i \in \ALPHABET N} \ALPHABET A_i\)</span> to denote the set of joint action of all players.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET T_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i \in \ALPHABET N\)</span>, the the set of <em>types</em> of player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We use <span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET T = \prod_{i \in \ALPHABET N}\)</span> to denote the set of joint types of all players.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\((Ω,\mathfrak{F}, \PR)\)</span> is a probability space where <span class="math inline">\(Ω\)</span> is the set of states of natures.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(τ_i \colon Ω \to \ALPHABET T_i\)</span> is the signal function for each player</li>

</div>
<p>Note that given the probability measure on <span class="math inline">\(Ω\)</span>, we can compute a measure <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\ALPHABET T\)</span>.

<p>We first consider the case when P1 is playing a pure strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>If P1.1 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\F\)</span>, BR of P2.1 is <span class="math inline">\(\F\)</span> and BR of P2.2 is <span class="math inline">\(\O\)</span>.</li>
<li>If P2 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\F\O\)</span>, BR of P1.1 is <span class="math inline">\(\F\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\((\F,\F\O)\)</span> is NE.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If P1.1 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\O\)</span>, BR of P2.1 is <span class="math inline">\(\O\)</span> and BR of P2.2 is <span class="math inline">\(\F\)</span>.</li>
<li>If P2 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\O\F\)</span>, BR of P1.1 is <span class="math inline">\(\F\)</span>. Hence, there is no NE in which P1 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\O\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the only pure strategy NE is <span class="math inline">\((\F,\F\O)\)</span>. This can also be verified in the ex-anti representation.</p>
<hr />
<p>We now consider the case when P1 is playing a mixed strategy <span class="math inline">\(α_1 = (p, 1-p)\)</span>. Consider a mixed strategy <span class="math inline">\(α_{2.1} = (q_1, 1-q_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(α_{2.2} = (q_2, 1-q_2)\)</span>. Note that we have assumed that <span class="math inline">\(p \in (0,1)\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_2 \in [0,1]\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(q_1 \in (0,1)\)</span>, then by the indifference principle, we have <span class="math display">\[ U_2(α_1, \F \mid t_2 = 1) = U_2(α_1, \O \mid t_2 = 1)\]</span> Hence, <span class="math display">\[ p = 2(1-p) \implies p = \frac 23. \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(q_2 \in (0,1)\)</span>, then by the indifference principle, we have <span class="math display">\[ U_2(α_1, \F \mid t_2 = 2) = U_2(α_1, \O \mid t_2 = 2)\]</span> Hence, <span class="math display">\[ (1-p) = 2p \implies p = \frac 13. \]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>But, <strong>only one of these can be true.</strong>. Thus, either <span class="math display">\[
    \bigl\{ q_1 \in (0,1) \text{ and } q_2 \in \{0, 1\} \bigr\}
    \quad\text{or}\quad
    \bigl\{ q_1 \in \{0,1\} \text{ and } q_2 \in (0, 1) \bigr\}
\]</span></p>
<p>We will consider both cases separately.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="case-1-q_1-in-01-q_2-in-01-p-tfrac-23.">Case 1: <span class="math inline">\(q_1 \in (0,1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q_2 \in \{0,1\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = \tfrac 23\)</span>.</h4>
<p>Note that <span class="math display">\[
  U_2(α_1, \F \mid t_2 = 2) = \tfrac 13 ,
  \quad
  U_2(α_1, \O \mid t_2 = 2) = \tfrac 43.
\]</span> Thus, the best response of P2.2 to <span class="math inline">\(α_1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\O\)</span>. Then, the strategy of P2 is <span class="math inline">\(α_2 = (0, q_1, 0, 1-q_1)\)</span>. Since P1 is playing a mixed strategy, by the invariance principle <span class="math display">\[
  U_1(\F, α_2 \mid t_1 = 1) = U_1(\O, α_2 \mid t_1 = 1)
\]</span> Hence, <span class="math display">\[ q_1 = \tfrac 12 q_1 + (1-q_1) \implies q_1 = \tfrac 23. \]</span> We have already checked that P2.2 is playing a BR. Hence, <span class="math display">\[

<li><p>For P1.1, <span class="math inline">\(\T\)</span> is dominated by <span class="math inline">\(\B\)</span>. This eliminates <span class="math inline">\(\T\T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\T\B\)</span> strategies from P2.1 and P2.2’s reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>In the reduced game, <span class="math inline">\(\L\)</span> is dominated by <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span> for P2.1. This eliminates strategies <span class="math inline">\(\L\L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\L\R\)</span> from P1.1 and P1.2’s reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>In the reduced game, <span class="math inline">\(\T\)</span> is dominated by <span class="math inline">\(\B\)</span> for P1.2. This eliminates strategies <span class="math inline">\(\B\T\)</span> from P2.1 and P2.2’s reasoning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, we are left with a unique strategy: <span class="math display">\[
  P1.1: \B, \quad
  P1.2: \B, \quad
  P2.1: \R, \quad
  P2.2: \R.
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that when <span class="math inline">\(ω = ω_3\)</span>, P1 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\B\)</span> and P2 is playing <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span>. Both players know the game, but the good outcome <span class="math inline">\((\T, \L)\)</span> has been ruled out even though it is the Nash equilibrium of the game corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(ω = ω_3\)</span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="examples-of-bayesian-games-with-continuous-actions"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Examples of Bayesian games with continuous actions</h1>
<p>We now present a few examples of Bayesian games with continuous action spaces.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="first-price-auctions"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Example: Sealed bid first price auctions</h2>
<p>Two players bid for one object. Let <span class="math inline">\(v_i \in [0,1]\)</span> denote the value that player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> assigns to the object. This is the player’s private information. Each player places a bid <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> on the object. The player with the highest bid wins.</p>
<p>We can model this as a Bayesian game where <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> are the player’s types. We model them as random variables, taking values in <span class="math inline">\(Ω = [0,1]^2\)</span> and assume a uniform distribution on <span class="math inline">\(Ω\)</span>. The utility of player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[
  u_i(b_i, b_j, v_i, v_j) = 
  \begin{cases}
      v_i - b_i, &amp; \text{if } b_i &gt; b_j \\
      \frac{v_i - b_i}{2}, &amp; \text{if } b_i = b_j \\
      0, &amp;\text{if } b_i &lt; b_j.
  \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>We will search for a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in the class of linear strategies, i.e., we will assume that <span class="math display">\[
  s_i(v_i) = α_i v_i
\]</span> and try to find <span class="math inline">\(α_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>For games with continuous action spaces, it is always better to take the interim approach. So, we construct the interim expected utility: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  U_i(b_i, s_j \mid v_i) &amp;=
  \int_{0}^1 u_i(v_i, v_j, b_i, s_j(v_j), f(v_j|v_i) d v_j \\
  &amp;\stackrel{(a)}=
  \underbrace{\int_{0}^{(b_i/α_j)^-} (v_i - b_i) dv_j}_{\text{Bid $i$ is bigger}}
  +
  \underbrace{\int_{(b_i/a_j)^{-}}^{(b_i/a_j)^{+}} \frac{(v_i - b_i)}{2} dv_j}_
  {\text{Both bids are equal}}
  +

\end{align*}\]</span> where in <span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span> we have used the fact that the conditional density <span class="math inline">\(f(v_j|v_i) = 1\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is concave in <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>. Thus, the interim best response can be obtained by the first order optimality condition: <span class="math display">\[
  \frac{∂ U_i(b_i, s_j \mid v_i)}{∂b_i} = 0
\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[
  b_i = \frac{v_i}{2}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, Bayesian Nash equilibrium is <strong>efficient</strong> because the player with the highest valuation wins.</p>
<hr />
<p>By a similar argument, we can show that in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-player auctions, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium is to bid <span class="math display">\[
  b_i = \left(1 - \frac 1n\right) v_i.
\]</span> Thus, the players shade their bid below their valuation to balance the profit when they win against the risk of not winning. The more the players in the auction, the less they can afford to shade their bid.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="second-price-auctions"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Example: Sealed bid second price auctions</h2>
<p>We had considered second price autions earlier but had assumed that the valuations of all players were common knowledge. Now we consider the case where the players know their own valuation but not the valuation of others.</p>
<p>We consider the two player setup similar to first price auctions but, in the case of second price auctions, the valuation function is given by <span class="math display">\[
  u_i(b_i, b_j, v_i, v_j) = 
  \begin{cases}
      v_i - {\color{red} b_j}, &amp; \text{if } b_i &gt; b_j \\
      \frac{v_i - {\color{red} b_j}}{2}, &amp; \text{if } b_i = b_j \\
      0, &amp;\text{if } b_i &lt; b_j.
  \end{cases}
\]</span> Again, we search for equilibrium in the class of linear strategies <span class="math inline">\(s_i(v_i) = α_i v_i\)</span>. As before <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  U_i(b_i, s_j \mid v_i) &amp;=
  \int_{0}^1 u_i(v_i, v_j, b_i, s_j(v_j), f(v_j|v_i) d v_j \\
  &amp;\stackrel{(a)}=
  \underbrace{\int_{0}^{(b_i/α_j)^-} (v_i - {\color{red} α_j v_j}) dv_j}_{\text{Bid $i$ is bigger}}
  +
  \underbrace{\int_{(b_i/a_j)^{-}}^{(b_i/a_j)^{+}} \frac{(v_i - {\color{red} α_j v_j})}{2} dv_j}_
  {\text{Both bids are equal}}
  + 
  \underbrace{\int_{(b_i/a_j)^{+}}^1 0 dv_j}_{\text{Bid $i$ is smaller}}
  \\
  &amp;= \frac{v_i b_i}{α_j} - \frac{b_i^2}{2α_j}
\end{align*}\]</span> where in <span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span> we have used the fact that the conditional density <span class="math inline">\(f(v_j|v_i) = 1\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is concave in <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>. Thus, the interim best response can be obtained by the first order optimality condition: <span class="math display">\[
  \frac{∂ U_i(b_i, s_j \mid v_i)}{∂b_i} = 0
\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[
  b_i = v_i.
\]</span> Thus, truthful bidding is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="example-first-price-sealed-bid-auctions-with-common-value"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Example: First price sealed bid auctions with common value</h2>
<p>Consider the same setup as first price sealed bid auctions but assume that the valuation of the object is <span class="math inline">\(v = v_1 + v_2\)</span>. Thus, the utility function is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  u_i(b_i, b_j, v_i, v_j) = 
  \begin{cases}
    v_1 + v_2 - b_i, &amp; \text{if } b_i &gt; b_j \\
    \frac{v_1 + v_2 - b_i}{2}, &amp; \text{if } b_i = b_j \\
    0, \text{if } b_i &lt; b_j.
  \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>As before, we search for BNE in linear strategies of the form <span class="math display">\[
  s_i(v_i) = α_i v_i.
\]</span></p>
<p>The expected interim utility is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  U_i(b_i, s_j \mid v_i) &amp;=
  \int_0^1 u_i(v_i, v_j, b_i, s_j(v_j)) f(v_j \mid v_i) dv_j
  \\
  &amp;\stackrel{(a)}=
  \underbrace{\int_0^{(b_i/α_j)^{-}} (v_i + v_j - b_i) dv_j}_
  {\text{Bid $i$ is bigger}}
  + 
  \underbrace{\int_{(b_i/α_j)^{-}}^{(b_i/α_j)^+} \frac{v_i + v_j - b_i}{2} dv_j}_
  {\text{Both bids are equal}
  + 
  \underbrace{\int_{(b_i/α_j)^+}^1 0 dv_j}_
  {\text{Bid $i$ is smaller}
  \\
  &amp;= (v_i  -b_i)\frac{b_i}{α_j} + \frac{b_i^2}{2α_j^2}.
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>where in <span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span> we have used the fact that the conditional density <span class="math inline">\(f(v_j|v_i) = 1\)</span>. Assuming <span class="math inline">\(2α_j - 1 &gt; 0\)</span>, we get that <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is concave in <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> and the interim best response can be obtained by the first order optimality condition: <span class="math display">\[
  \frac{∂ U_i(b_i, s_j \mid v_i)}{∂b_i} = 0
\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[
  b_i = \frac{α_j}{2α_j - 1} v_i
\]</span></p>
<p>By symmetry, we will get that <span class="math display">\[
  b_j = \frac{α_i}{2α_i - 1} v_j.
\]</span></p>
<p>But we started by assuming that <span class="math inline">\(b_i = α_i v_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_j = α_j v_j\)</span>. This gives us the condition that <span class="math display">\[
  α_1 = \frac{α_2}{2α_2 - 1}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  α_2 = \frac{α_1}{2α_1 - 1}
\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[
  α_1 + α_2 = 2α_1 α_2.
\]</span></p>
<p>If we look for symmetric solutions (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(α_1 = α_2\)</span>) then we get that <span class="math inline">\(α_1 = α_2 = 1\)</span>. Thus, the equilibrium bidding strategy is <span class="math display">\[b_i = v_i.\]</span></p>
